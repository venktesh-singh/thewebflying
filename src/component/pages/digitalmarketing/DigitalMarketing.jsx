                                <h6>What Is The Difference Between SEO and PPC?</h6>
                                <p>
                                    Organic Traffic vs. Paid Search Advertising<br />
                                    The main difference between Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Pay Per Click (PPC) is that traffic coming from SEO (organic) is free or organic it will not let you pay any cost. While traffic generated from PPC is
                                    not free as the name implies you have to pay a cost per click. Both SEO and PPC are part of Search Engine Marketing (SEM) which is one of the tools you can use as part of your overall digital marketing campaign. Here
                                    <strong><a href="https://www.thewebflying.com/">Digital marketing company in Japan</a></strong> will help you to understand are the major differences between the two I will explain to you by using the following
                                    parameters like a position in search engine results, cost of the campaign, traffic potential, conversion rate and ease of use.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>SEO:</b> The cost of SEO is indirect like using outsource or spending time on SEO. You cannot pay or purchase <strong>the first-page position</strong> to get to the first page, but you may have to pay for SEO
                                    services if you cannot do SEO
                                </p>
                                <p>yourself.</p>
                                <p><b>PPC:</b> You pay whenever any people click on your ad and visit your website. You can use the Google keyword tool to calculate an average spent money.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Cost:</b> As you know that <strong><a href="SEO-company-india.php">SEO traffic</a></strong> is free and organically searched but PPC is a paid version of SEM and while this is true, you should understand that it
                                    needs a lot of effort and hard work to get free traffic from search engines and numbers of people working for that.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    <b>Traffic potential</b> SEO: Organic traffic is continuous as long as you are ranking in one of the top positions of the search engine. PPC: PPC ads can get more clicks but this means that you pay more and it can
                                    cost more.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Conversion Which visitor is far more likely to convert (i.e. Create a purchase, register to a newsletter and general reaction to call for actions ), somebody coming out of
                                    <strong><a href="digital-marketing-company-india.php">PPC Advertising or from search?</a></strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And optimized afterward a visitor out of PPC is far more likely to convert than a guest coming out of the hunt. The main reason is that a web page Can rank for various keywords (besides those originally planned ) so
                                    the lookup customer might not be looking precisely for the articles (or merchandise) exhibited on the specific page.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Successful PPC campaign then you'll just get clicks from people who are Curious 100 percent in your articles or merchandise. SEO: SEO traffic is much purified and better than other forms of traffic (i.e. social
                                    media) but in terms of conversion PPC score more conversion rate. PPC: Highly optimized keywords as per search result and business oriented will generate more conversions but will cost more. Ease of use Neither SEO
                                    nor PPC is easy to do if you don‚Äôt have sufficient knowledge and experience of the <strong>search engine algorithm</strong>. SEO is a process that takes a lot of time and effort including on-page and off-page. It may
                                    take months or even years to rank for specific terms or not rank at all which is dependent upon the competitors and keyword difficulty!
